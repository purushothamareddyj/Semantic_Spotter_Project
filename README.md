# Insurance Documents QA RAG Chatbot  
Your Intelligent Chat Assistant for Insurance Document Queries  

---

## ✨ About the Project  
The Insurance Documents QA RAG Chatbot is an advanced conversational assistant designed to streamline complex queries on insurance documents while also providing general information by conducting internet searches. Utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, the chatbot intelligently determines whether to retrieve information from a document or the web, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## 🔍 Key Features  
- ✨ **Dual-Functionality Query Resolution**: Handles document-specific and general queries with smart tool selection.  
- ☆ **Efficient Retrieval**: Employs **LlamaIndex** for accurate and efficient insurance data retrieval.  
- ✪ **Agentic Generation**: Uses **LangChain** to intelligently generate responses or search the web for answers.  
- ✨ **Scalable Embedding Storage**: Leverages **ChromaDB** to store and query embeddings with speed and accuracy.  
- 🔑 **Advanced Caching Mechanism**: Minimizes redundant computations with:  
  - Embedding-level cache for reprocessing prevention.  
  - Query/answer cache for repeated queries.  
- 🔄 **Dynamic Chunking**: Splits documents for optimal information retrieval.  
- 🕒 **Real-Time Adaptability**: Decides between data retrieval and internet search based on query type.
